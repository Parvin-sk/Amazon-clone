This project is a basic clone of the Amazon website, crafted using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the visual layout and design of Amazon's homepage, offering a practical example of web design and front-end development. The clone includes a navigation bar similar to Amazonâ€™s, which provides a clean and intuitive interface for navigating through various sections. Additionally, it features a product listing area designed to mimic Amazon's catalog, displaying product images, titles, and prices in a structured grid layout.<br>

The design is fully responsive, ensuring that the layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, whether viewed on a desktop or mobile device. This project showcases essential web development skills by focusing on creating a static, visually appealing replica of a well-known e-commerce site. While it does not include dynamic features or backend functionality, it serves as a solid foundation for understanding how to structure and style a web page to resemble a complex site like Amazon.
